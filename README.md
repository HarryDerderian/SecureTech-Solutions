Running the Client (client.exe)
To launch the chat client, simply double-click client.exe.

⚠️ Important Notice — False Positive Warning:
When you run the file, Windows SmartScreen or your antivirus may flag it. This happens because the executable is unsigned and from an unknown publisher.

Click "More info", then "Run anyway" to continue.

This is a false positive — there is no malware in the application.

What This Does
Running client.exe will connect you to the online server and establish a secure, encrypted connection over TLS. Once connected, you’ll be able to chat with other users in real time using a clean, intuitive interface.

Requirements
Windows OS is required.

Internet access must be available to reach the online server.

Using the Interface
Click "Connect" to begin the secure session with the server.

You’ll be prompted to log in or register if you haven’t already.

Use the Send, Clear, and Close buttons as needed.

Type messages into the gray input box and press Enter or click Send to communicate.

The server is already online and configured to accept connections. Just launch the client and you’re ready to go.
